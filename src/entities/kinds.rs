    // category traits (Bondable, Atomlike etc.).

    // What makes this trait sealed currently is the fact that Id is not
    // nameable by other crates, so foreign types cannot implement new_unchecked

    // a specific kind from a generic Id without the discriminant being
    // checked, so it is *essential* that new_unchecked not just cannot be
    // *implemented* but also cannot be *called*. As long as Id stays
    // unnameable, this is the case.
