//! The data held by an `AtomGraph` for the fundamental entities, and the view
//! methods to access it.
//!
//! # A note on crate organization
//!
//! By the very nature of the MolMap types, the data and functionality pertaining
//! to a particular kind of entity is implemented across many different types.
//! Some data is contained in the MolGraph, in the structs defined below, while
//! some (e.g. positional information) is held by higher map types.
//! Some of the internal functions that handle the entities are defined on
//! MolGraph, some in the MolMap trait, some on the higher maps such as MolMap0
//! or SpatialMolMap, some on the entities, and a very small number of them on
//! the data structs themselves.
//! Because Rust is compiled by crate, we are presented with two good options for
//! organizing the code.
//!
//! Firstly, it would actually be possible to collect *everything* related to a
//! single entity type together, e.g. put all code for atoms in a single `atom`
//! module, and do likewise for each of the entity types. This would put the
//! definition of the corresponding Entity type, the core data struct, any
//! additional data, the methods on the different maps, the methods on the
//! different views, etc. all in a single file. General things, such as the
//! Entity trait or the macro to define a new Kind, would remain at the top level.
//!
//! The other good option, and the one currently taken, is to organize the code
//! into modules by the thing being implemented e.g. the core data, spatial data,
//! methods on MolGraph, on MolMap, on SpatialMolMap, on the general MolMap views,
//! on SpatialMolMap views, etc.
//! If desired this approach can be further split up e.g. different modules for
//! the different kinds of functionality of a SpatialMolMap.
//!
//! The first approach would make it easier to see and change the behaviour of a
//! single kind of entity all at once, and to have a better overview of what is
//! implemented for it at each level.
//! However, it makes parallel implementation of the same or similar things for
//! multiple kinds of entity much harder.
//! It also creates a lot of circular dependencies, which while not technically a
//! problem due to the crate-level compilation do still feel kind of bad.
//! The second option also fits better the way the crate is actually used - you
//! are more likely to want to work with (and thus import) the Entity types for
//! all kinds of entity at once, or all spatial stuff for all kinds at once.
//!
//! As such, this module contains the **core data structs** for *all* entity
//! kinds in a single file, as well as any **methods on completely generic views**
//! for access and manipulation **of the core data**.
//! As the maps are generally expected to want side-effects to occur when the
//! core data is changed, the methods implemented completely generically are
//! on the whole (currently, exclusively) confined to *access* via the immutable
//! views.
//!
//! It also currently contains many types necessary for the definitions of the
//! core structs e.g. [`BondType`] and [`SubstituentCentre`], but these may well
//! be moved in the future.

/// The point at which a stablizing interaction between two entities becomes a bond can
/// be difficult to define, especially as the strength of interactions is often affected
/// by the environment. What is referred to as a "bond" and what as merely an
/// "interaction" is mostly based on the range of strengths of the class of interaction
/// rather than the strength of any individual example. Hydrogen bonds, for example, are
/// usually referred to as bonds, and while indeed they can be very strong – stronger
/// than some covalent bonds – most hydrogen bonds are quite weak interactions.
/// Meanwhile, various kinds of non-covalent interaction are almost never considered
/// bonds.
///
/// `molmap` avoids making a distinction between bonding and non-bonding interactions.
/// In `molmap`, a `Bond` entity may represent any interaction that it is desirable to
/// indicate or depict explicitly. A `Bond` may even be a hypothetical one that is yet
/// to be realized.
///
/// However, in most contexts it does not make sense to consider weak non-covalent
/// interactions as bonds. To aid this, the possible bond types are categorized as
/// "strong" and "weak", with only covalent/dipolar, metallic, and ionic considered
/// strong (as well as the catch-all `OtherStrong` variant). The [`is_strong`] method is
/// provided to test this predicate.
/// Generally, only bonds with "strong" bond types are considered edges in the graph.
///
/// In other contexts it may be preferable to only consider bonds classed as covalent
/// (which includes dipolar bonds), for which the [`is_covalent`] method is provided.
/// Only covalent/dipolar bonds affect the calculation of electron counts and formal
