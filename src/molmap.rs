//! The traits implemented by all forms of `MolMap`.
//!
//! The Entity and Kind traits allow methods of MolGraph and the MolMap types to
//! be generic over all kinds of entity.
//! However, the number of generic methods on MolMap types in the _public_ API
//! (either as trait methods or methods on the concrete types) is limited, as:
//! - methods that involve existing entities should go via the respective View
//!   or ViewMut
//! - methods that are different for each entity type (e.g. entity addition)
//!   should generally not be generic

/// exposed publicly, hence the re-export in `crate::traits` is `pub(crate)`.
///
/// The use of this trait as a bound for `MolMap` makes it an example of the
/// sealed trait pattern, see

/// 1. obtaining an immutable or mutable view of an entity from its ID
/// 2. verifying an ID
/// 3. iterating over views of all of a given kind of entity
/// 4. iterating over all IDs of a given kind of entity
///
/// All implementors of `MolMap` should also always provide methods for adding new
